# List of rate limit zones identified by their "host" field.
# 'Host' header of the HTTP request is matched with each of these "host" fields.
# Rate limit control of the first matched zone in the list will be applied to
# the HTTP request.
zones:
    - host: *  # Apply to requests forwarded to all domains.
      shared: true  # The rate limit is shared by all domains.
      controller: rps  # Use request-per-second rate limit control.
      limit: 2  # At most 2 requests per second in the entire zone.

# Example - Throttle *.github.com and other domains with different settings.

# zones:
#     - host: *.github.com  # Apply to requests forwarded to all sub-domains of github.com.
#       shared: false  # The rate limit is applied to each sub-domain separately.
#       controller: rps  # Use request-per-second rate limit control.
#       limit: 3  # At most 3 requests per second forwarded per each sub-domain.
#     - host: *  # Apply to all requests forwarded to non- github.com.
